# Entry #0 - 07-07-25

Research on the components

So for this entry, I've been mainly just going around scouting components
in digikey.

Here are some obsidian notes:

# Entry #1 - 07-19-25 - Researching more components


Total hours spent: 5 hours


# Entry #2 - 07-22-25 - Researching Power Electronics & Doing the Schematic

For this entry, I've started doing the schematic. I only focused on making this a power only PCB, and I focused the most on getting the power part to work so I can work with the PCB straight away.

Here is another peek of my obisdian note for power calculations:

# Entry #4 - 07-24-25 - Finishing up the schematic for power management

In this journal, I mainly polished up the schematic. I've been reading a lot of datasheets and been scrolling thru a lot of them, just to make sure I don't  get anything wrong.

Here's the final schematic (Power management only since this PCB is for that)

Also, I've gotten a jumpstart at the PCB. Its been in the making currently. Didn't get any pictures sadly, forgot em.

# Entry #5 - 07-25-25 - Finishing the PCB Layout for power management

In this entry, I have finished up the PCB layout. Here is how it looks:

Also, I've gotten a jumptart of the CAD. I've been mainly thinking about how to fit all of these components. For example, how would I fit the PCB, thermal printer, and Arducam inside it?

Also, I've been brainstorming what the hell do I do with the buttons. I heard its great to have a square on top of the tactile switch with 0.5mm clearance. so I did that on top of the circular model of the button. I did that for both buttons! Power and shutter, which have self-explanatory usages for cameras.

# Entry #6 - 07-26-25 - Finishing up the CAD 

I've been experimenting with how to mount the PCB so that it is stable throughout the usage of the PCB. I decided to go for screws with the standoffs so it doesnt fall on the ceiling of the CAD.

Aaaandd... here is what the final CAD looks like! I decided to make this super simple. I didn't want it to be that designy, since I just wanted to use this

Here is what it looks like:

That's pretty much it!
